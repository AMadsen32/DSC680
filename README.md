# Breast Cancer IDC Analysis

# The data set I am using consists of a Wiconsin diagnostic set containing multiple variables related to breast cancer imaging:

# ID - ID number for each case
# Diagnosis - Designation of M or B for Malignant or Benign
# Radius_Mean - Mean of distance from center to point
# Texture_Mean - Std. Dev of grey scale imaging 
# Perimeter_Mean - Mean size of the tumor
# Area_Mean - Area of tumor
# Smoothness - Mean of local variation/radius
# Compactness - Mean of Perimeter sq. 
# Concavity - Mean severity of concave imaging points
# Concave Points - Mean for the number of concave points

# These variables are used to detect IDC points in various images of breast cancer patients.
